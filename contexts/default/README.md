# Default Context

The Readium Web Publication Manifest defines a shared external context document hosted by the Readium Foundation and based primarily on schema.org and its extensions.

This context is meant primarily to:

- align the Web Publication Manifest with the Web by adopting schema.org and its extensions
- provide compatibility with EPUB 3 by providing equivalent metadata elements based on schema.org


| Name  | URI | Description | Required? |
| ----- | --- | ----------- | --------- |
Default Context | [https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/context.jsonld](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/context.jsonld) | Default context definition used in every Readium Web Publication Manifest. | Yes |


## Title

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">must</span> contain a single title using the `title` element:

```json
"title": "Moby-Dick"
```

In addition to a simple string representation, the `title` element also supports alternate representations of the same string in different scripts and languages.

To provide these alternate representations, an object may be used instead of a string, where each key identifies a language/script and must be a valid [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tag:

```json
"title": {
  "fr": "Vingt mille lieues sous les mers",
  "en": "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea",
  "ja": "海底二万里"
}
```

In addition to the `title` element, the manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> also contain an optional `subtitle` element with exactly the same syntax.

```json
"title": "Flatland"
"subtitle": "A Romance of Many Dimensions"
```

The manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> also contain a `sortAs` element to provide a single sortable string, used by a client to organize a collection of publications:

```json
"title": "A Tale of Two Cities"
"sortAs": "Tale of Two Cities, A"
```

## Identifier

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">should</span> contain an identifier. The identifier must be a valid URI:

```json
"identifier": "http://example.com/publication"
```


## Contributors

The default context for the Web Publication Manifest provides a number of elements to indicate the nature of a contributor: `author`, `translator`, `editor`, `artist`, `illustrator`, `letterer`, `penciler`, `colorist`, `inker` and `narrator`.

In addition to these elements, it also provides a generic term for contributors: `contributor`.

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">should</span> contain one or more contributors.

The most straightforward expression of a contributor is through a simple string:

```json
"author": "James Joyce"
```

Each element can also contain multiple contributors using a simple array:

```json
"artist": ["Shawn McManus", "Colleen Doran", "Bryan Talbot"]
```

In addition to a simple string representation, each contributor can also be represented using an object using the following elements: `name`, `sortAs` and `identifier`.

When an object is used, it must contain at least `name`. 

It behaves like the `title` element and allows either a simple strings, or representations in multiple languages and scripts of a contributor's name:

```json
"author": {
  "name": {
    "ru": "Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков",
    "en": "Mikhail Bulgakov",
    "fr": "Mikhaïl Boulgakov"
  }
}
```

The contributor object may also contain a `sortAs` element to provide a single sortable string, used by a client to organize a collection of publications:

```json
"author": {
  "name": "Marcel Proust",
  "sortAs": "Proust, Marcel"
}
```

Finally, the object may also contain an `identifier`. The `identifier` must be a URI.

ISNI (http://isni.org) is the preferred authority, but other sources may also be used:

```json
"author": {
  "name": "Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly",
  "sortAs": "Barbey d'Aurevilly, Jules Amédée",
  "identifier": "http://isni.org/isni/0000000121317806"
}
```

If none of the elements available are specific enough, a `contributor` element <span class="rfc">may</span> be used instead. 

The `contributor` element should be used with an object that contains a `role`. 
All values for the `role` element should be based on [MARC relator codes](https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html): 

```json
"contributor": {
  "name": "Lou Reed",
  "role": "sng"
}
```

## Language

In order to indicate its primary language, a Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">should</span> use a `language` element. Its value must be a valid [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tag.

```json
"language": "en"
```

If a publication has more than one primary language (a bilingual edition for example), the `language` element <span class="rfc">may</span> contain an array of values:

```json
"language": ["en", "fr", "ja"]
```

## Description

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> contain a description of the publication in plain text using the `description` element:

```json
"description": "The story of two gnomes, discussing the meaning of life in a Scandivanian garden."
```

## Publisher

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> list one or more publishers using the `publisher` element.

To provide even more details, it's also possible to use the `imprint` element that behaves exactly like `publisher` but provides a complementary information.

The most straightforward expression is through a simple string:

```json
"publisher": "Literary Fiction Ltd."
"imprint": "World Literature"
```

This element also allows a more complex representation using an object and the following elements: `name`, `sortAs`, `identifier`. The semantics and syntax are identical to contributors:

```json
"publisher": {
  "name": "The Science Fiction Company",
  "sortAs": "Science Fiction Company, The",
  "identifier": "http://example.com/publisher/TheScienceFictionCompany"
}
```

Multiple publishers can be listed in this element using the string or object representations.


## Publication date

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> contain a publication date using the `published` element. The publication date must be a valid ISO 8601 date.

```json
"published": "2016-09-02"
```

## Modification date

Publications can be updated and to identify each specific version, the manifest <span class="rfc">should</span> also contain a `modified` element containing the timestamp when the publication was last modified expressed as an ISO 8601 time and date:

```json
"modified": "2016-02-22T11:31:38Z"
```

## Subjects

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> also provide one or more subjects using the `subject` element:

```json
"subject": "Historical Fiction"
```

Multiple subjects are listed using an array:

```json
"subject": ["Science Fiction", "Fantasy"]
```

Subjects can also be expressed using an object with the following elements: `name`, `sortAs`, `code` and `scheme`.

`name` is meant to provide a human readable string for the subject, while `sortAs` is meant to provide a string that a machine can sort: 

```json
"subject": {
  "name": "Manga: Shonen",
  "sortAs": "Shonen"
}
```

In many fields and territories, a number of controlled vocabularies are in use to identify subjects. For example THEMA is used in the publishing industry to provide an international subject scheme.

To indicate that a subject belongs to a particular scheme, the `scheme` element is available. The `scheme` must be a URI.

The `code` element is available to provide the string that identifies the subject in a given scheme:

```json
"subject": {
  "name": "Manga: Shonen",
  "sortAs": "Shonen",
  "scheme": "http://www.editeur.org/151/Thema/",
  "code": "XAMG"
}
```

## Collections & series

A Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> indicate that it belongs to one or multiple collections/series.

`collection` and `series` behave the same way, the most straightforward way to indicate that a publication belongs to a collection/series is through a simple string:

```json
"belongsTo": {
  "collection": "Mysteries from Another Time",
  "series": "The Zombie Detective"
}
```

In order to provide more information about a specific collection/series, an object can also be used instead of a string.

To provide a name and a sortable string, `collection` and `series` support both `name` and `sortAs`:

```json
"belongsTo": {
  "series": {
    "name": "The Zombie Detective",
    "sortAs": "Zombie Detective, The"
  }
}
```

A collection/series can also have an identifier, provided using the `identifier`
element. The identifier must be a URI:

```json
"belongsTo": {
  "series": {
    "name": "The Zombie Detective",
    "sortAs": "Zombie Detective, The",
    "identifier": "http://www.example.com/series/TheZombieDetective"
  }
}
```

Finally, series/collection can be ordered. To provide the position of the current publication in a series/collection, the `position` element can be used.

A position can be either an integer or a float where the value is greater than zero.

```json
"belongsTo": {
  "series": {
    "name": "The Zombie Detective",
    "sortAs": "Zombie Detective, The",
    "identifier": "http://www.example.com/series/TheZombieDetective",
    "position": 4
  }
}
```

## Reading progression direction

To properly browse through a publication, a User Agent needs to know its progression direction.

A manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> express this information using `readingProgression`. 

It allows the following values: `ltr` (left to right), `rtl` (right to left), `ttb` (top to bottom), `btt` (bottom to top) and `auto`.

It defaults to `auto` when no value is set.

## Duration and number of pages

To indicate the length of a publication, a Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">may</span> include the `duration` and `numberOfPages` properties.

`duration` is expressed in seconds using a float (number in JSON), while `numberOfPages` is an integer.

```json
"duration": 5467
"numberOfPages": 178
```

In addition to these two properties, `abridged` is used to indicate an abridged edition of a publication. This is expressed using a boolean.

```json
"abridged": true
```

## Accessibility metadata

In order to document its accessibility metadata, a Web Publication Manifest <span class="rfc">should</span> include an `accessibility` object.

This `accessibility` object <span class="rfc">may</span> contain the following properties: `conformsTo`, `certification`, `accessMode`, `accessModeSufficient`, `feature`, `hazard` and `summary`.

### Conformance

`conformsTo` contains one or more URI, meant to convey that a publication conforms to a specific accessibility profile.

This specification identifies the following profiles:

| Profile | URI |
| ------- | --- |
| EPUB Accessibility 1.0 - WCAG 2.0 Level A | <http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-a> |
| EPUB Accessibility 1.0 - WCAG 2.0 Level AA | <http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa> |
| EPUB Accessibility 1.0 - WCAG 2.0 Level AAA | <http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aaa> |

### Certification

The `certification` object contains information about the certification process of a publication.

`certifiedBy` identifies the person or the organization that conducted the certification.

`credential` provides additional credentials regarding the ability of the certifier to conduct an accessibility report.

`report` points to one or more accessibility reports for the publication, using a list of URL.

```json
"certification": {
  "certifiedBy": "Tom Smith",
  "report": "https://example.com/report/a11y",
  "credential": "Certified by Benetech"
}
```

### accessMode and accessModeSufficient

`accessMode` and `accessModeSufficient` are meant to list the human sensory perceptual systems or cognitive faculties necessary to access a given publication.

While `accessMode` provides a complete list, `accessModeSufficient` is focused on list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource.

Both properties are controlled by external vocabularies maintained by the W3C.

| Property | Controlled vocabulary |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `accessMode` | <https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessMode-vocabulary> |
| `accessModeSufficient` | <https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessModeSufficient-vocabulary> |

```json
"accessibility": {
  "accessMode": ["textual", "visual"],
  "accessModeSufficient": [
    ["textual", "visual"],
    "textual"
  ],
  "feature": ["alternativeText"]
}
```


### Features and hazards

`feature` and `hazard` provide a list of potential accessibility features or hazards for a publication.

Both properties are controlled by external vocabularies maintained by the W3C.

| Property | Controlled vocabulary |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `feature` | <https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature-vocabulary> |
| `hazard` | <https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityHazard-vocabulary> |

```json
"accessibility": {
  "feature": [
    "alternativeText", 
    "displayTransformability", 
    "readingOrder",
    "structuralNavigation",
    "tableOfContents"
  ],
  "hazard": ["none"]
}
```

### Summary

`summary` is meant to convey additional information about the accessibility of a publication that cannot be expressed using `conformsTo`, `certification`, `accessMode`, `accessModeSufficient`, `feature` or `hazard`.

```json
"summary": "The publication is recorded by a professional narrator."
```

## Appendix A - JSON Schema

The default context is implemented in the core JSON Schema for the Readium Web Publication Manifest and should be used as a reference as well.

The JSON Schema for metadata is under version control at [https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest/blob/master/schema/metadata.schema.json](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest/blob/master/schema/metadata.schema.json)

For the purpose of validating a Readium Web Publication Manifest, use the following JSON Schema resource: [https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/schema/publication.schema.json](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/schema/publication.schema.json)

## Appendix C - Mapping to EPUB

In order to convert EPUB packages into a Readium Web Publication Manifest, we've documented how each metadata item listed in the default context is mapped to an equivalent in EPUB 2.x or 3.x.
