## Introduction

The goal of this specification is to provide a profile dedicated to digital visual narratives (Divina) for the [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest).

## 1. Declaring conformance to the Divina profile

In order to declare that it conforms to the Divina Profile, a Readium Web Publication Manifest <strong class="rfc">must</strong>:

- include a `conformsTo` property in its `metadata` section, with `https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/profiles/divina` as one of its values
- use `application/divina+json` as its media type

While the Divina Manifest is technically a profile of the Readium Web Publication Manifest, the use of its dedicated media type is recommended to maximize compatibility with applications that may target comics/manga specifically.

## 2. Listing Resources

A visual narrative is divided into one or more images, which are all listed in the `readingOrder` of the manifest.

In addition to the normal requirements of a `readingOrder`, all Link Objects have the following additional requirements:
 
 - they <strong class="rfc">must</strong> point strictly to bitmap images

In addition, all Link Objects <strong class="rfc">should</strong> also include `width` and `height` to indicate the dimensions of each resource.

## 3. Alternate Resources

In order to provide multiple variants of the same resource, Link Objects in the `readingOrder` <strong class="rfc">may</strong> rely on the `alternate` key.

All Link Objects present in the `alternate` array:

- <strong class="rfc">must</strong> indicate their media-type using `type`
- <strong class="rfc">should</strong> indicate their dimensions using `height` and `width`
- <strong class="rfc">may</strong> target a different language using `language`

*Example 1: A resource available in JPEG and AVIF*

```json
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg", 
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1.avif", 
      "type": "image/avif"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Example 2: A resource available in French and Japanese*

```json
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg",
  "language": "fr",
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1-jp.jpeg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "language": "jp"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Example 3: A resource available in two different resolutions*

```json
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg",
  "width": 546,
  "height": 760,
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1-high.jpeg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "width": 1092,
      "height": 1520
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Layout

### 4.1. Fixed layout

By default, each publication that conforms to the Divina profile is handled like a fixed layout publications, which means that:

- the publication is paginated by default, where each page is an image from the `readingOrder`
- images are usually displayed with both dimensions fully contained in the viewport by default
- reading systems can decide to display two images side by side in a spread, using the [`page`](../properties.md#page) property as a hint

Reading systems are strongly encouraged to let the user decide if they prefer reading the publication:

- paginated or scrolled
- with or without spreads (for example, with spreads in landscape mode but without spreads in portrait mode)

Some publications may contain spreads where the user needs to navigate back and forth between both pages of the spread to read through the publication.

In order to convey this information, this profile introduces a new property for Link Objects:

<dl>
  <dt>meaningfulSpread</dt>
  <dd>Hint that the current resource should be presented in a spread to fully convey the meaning of its content.</dd>
</dl>

*Example 4: Meaningful spread in a manga*

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Kawaii Nekko",
    "identifier": "https://example.com/kawaii-nekko",
    "conformsTo": "https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/profiles/divina",
    "readingProgression": "rtl"
  },
  "readingOrder": [
    {
      "href": "cover.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": {
        "page": "center"
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "page1.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": {
        "page": "right"
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "page2.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": {
        "page": "left"
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "page3.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": {
        "page": "right",
        "meaningfulSpread": true
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "page4.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": {
        "page": "left",
        "meaningfulSpread": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.2. Scrolled publications

For publications where a single continuous scroll is required to properly display the publication (such as webtoons for example), content creators <strong class="rfc">should</strong> use the [`layout`](../contexts/default/README.md#layout-and-reading-progression) property with the `scrolled` value.

In order to override the default behaviour of displaying all images from the `readingOrder` in a single continuous scroll, this profile also introduces a new property for Link Objects:

<dl>
  <dt>breakScrollBefore</dt>
  <dd>Specifies that an item in the reading order should break the current continuous scroll and start a new one.</dd>
</dl>

*Example 5: A scrolled publication with a break in its continuous scroll*

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "The Cat Collector",
    "identifier": "https://example.com/cat-collector",
    "conformsTo": "https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/profiles/divina",
    "layout": "scrolled"
  },
  "readingOrder": [
    {
      "href": "episode1-image1.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    },
    {
      "href": "episode1-image2.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    },
    {
      "href": "episode1-image3.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    },
    {
      "href": "episode2-image1.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": {
        "breakScrollBefore": true
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "episode2-image2.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    },
    {
      "href": "episode2-image3.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Packaging

A Divina publication may be distributed unpackaged on the Web, but it may also be packaged for easy distribution as a single file. To achieve this goal, this specification relies on the [Readium Packaging Format](./packaging.md).

To maximize compatibility with dedicated apps, such a package has its own file extension and media-type:

- its file extension <strong class="rfc">must</strong> be `.divina`
- its media type <strong class="rfc">must</strong> be `application/divina+zip`

As an alternative, the manifest may also be included in:

- an EPUB 3 publication, as specified in the [Readium Packaging Format](./packaging.md#6-hybrid-epub-3--rpf-packages) specification
- or dedicated formats for comics such as CBZ/CBR
