## Introduction

The goal of this specification is to provide a profile of the [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest) specification dedicated to digital Visual Narratives.

This profile relies on:

* a specific [media type](#1-media-type)
* a declaration of [conformance with this Profile](#2-declaring-conformance-with-the-divina-profile),
* some [restrictions on the resources of the reading order](#3-restrictions-on-the-resources-of-the-reading-order),
* some [restrictions on the use of alternate resources](#4-alternate-resources)
* the definition of a new collection type for implementing [guided navigation](#5-guided-navigation),
* specific [details on packaging](#6-packaging)
* the use of [presentation hints](../modules/presentation.md) for specifying display constraints, 
* the use of [transitions](../modules/transitions.md) to manage transitions between resources of the reading order.

## 1. Media type

While the Digital Visual Narrative Manifest is technically a profile of the Readium Web Publication Manifest, it has its own media type in order to maximize compatibility with dedicated apps: `application/divina+json`.

## 2. Declaring conformance with the Divina Profile

To declare that it conforms to the Divina Profile, a Readium Web Publication Manifest <strong class="rfc">must</strong> include a `conformsTo` key in its `metadata` section, with `https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/profiles/divina` as value.

## 3. Restrictions on resources in the reading order

A Readium Web Publication Manifest that conforms to the Divina Profile <strong class="rfc">must</strong> strictly reference bitmap images in its `readingOrder`.

In addition, all Link Objects <strong class="rfc">should</strong> include `width` and `height` to indicate the dimensions of each resource.

## 4. Alternate Resources

To provide multiple variants of the same image content (using a different format or size for instance), Link Objects in the `readingOrder` <strong class="rfc">may</strong> rely on the `alternate` key.

All Link Objects present in the `alternate` array:

- <strong class="rfc">must</strong> indicate their media-type using `type`
- <strong class="rfc">should</strong> indicate their dimensions using `height` and `width`
- <strong class="rfc">may</strong> target a different language using `language`

*Example 1: A resource available in JPEG and WebP*

```json
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg", 
  "width": 600,
  "height": 800,
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1.webp", 
      "type": "image/webp",
      "width": 600,
      "height": 800
    }
  ]
}
```

*Example 2: A resource available in French and Japanese*

```json
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg",
  "language": "fr",
  "width": 600,
  "height": 800,
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1-jp.jpeg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "language": "jp",
      "width": 600,
      "height": 800
    }
  ]
}
```

*Example 3: A resource available in two different resolutions*

```json
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg",
  "width": 546,
  "height": 760,
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1-high.jpeg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "width": 1092,
      "height": 1520
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Guided Navigation

In addition to having [a table of contents](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/#6-table-of-contents), a visual narrative <strong class="rfc">may</strong> also provide guided navigation where each reference is either:

- pointing directly to a resource (`image1.jpg`)
- or to a fragment of a resource using [Media Fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags) (`image1.jpg#xywh=160,120,320,240`)

This document introduces a new collection role to fulfill that goal:

| Role  | Definition | Compact Collection? | Required? |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| `guided` | Identifies a collection containing guided navigation into a publication. | Yes  | No  |

To avoid duplicating content between `readingOrder` and `guided`, Link Objects referenced in `guided` <strong class="rfc">must</strong> only contain `href` and `title`.

This current draft does not cover guided navigation over alternate versions of each image resource.

*Example 4: Guided navigation with full page displayed before panels*

```json
"guided": [
  {
    "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg",
    "title": "Page 1"
  },
  {
    "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg#xywh=0,0,300,200",
    "title": "Panel 1"
  },
  {
    "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg#xywh=300,200,310,200",
    "title": "Panel 2"
  }
]
```

## 6. Packaging

A Divina publication may be distributed unpackaged on the Web, but it may also be packaged for easy distribution as a single file. To achieve this goal, this specification defines the [Readium Packaging Format (RPF)](../packaging.md).

To maximize compatibility with dedicated apps, such a package has its own file extension and media-type:

- its file extension <strong class="rfc">must</strong> be `.divina`
- its media type <strong class="rfc">must</strong> be `application/divina+zip`

As an alternative, the manifest may also be included into an EPUB 3 publication, an hybrid solution also specified in the [Readium Packaging Format (RPF)](../packaging.md) specification. This approach allows a publisher to create EPUB 3 fixed layout comics which are enriched by transitions, guided navigation, sounds etc. accessible via Divina compliant applications.

## Appendix B. Examples

*Example 5: A manga is a DiViNa where images are presented sequentially from right-to-left with a discontinuity between images that are not in the same spread*


```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Manga",
    "identifier": "https://example.com/manga",
    "conformsTo": "https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/profiles/divina",
    "readingProgression": "rtl",
    "presentation": {
      "fit": "contain",
      "spread": "landscape"
    }
  },
  "readingOrder": [
    {
      "rel": "cover",
      "href": "cover.jpg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": { "page": "center" }
    }, 
    {
      "href": "page1.jpg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": { "page": "right" }
    }, 
    {
      "href": "page2.jpg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "properties": { "page": "left" }
    }
  ]
}
```

*Example 6: A webtoon is a DiViNa where images are scrolled in a single continuous strip of content*


```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Webtoon",
    "identifier": "https://example.com/webtoon",
    "conformsTo": "https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/profiles/divina",
    "readingProgression": "ttb",
    "presentation": {
      "overflow": "scrolled",
      "fit": "width",
      "continuous": true
    }
  },
  "readingOrder": [
    {
      "href": "image1.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    },
    {
      "href": "image2.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    },
    {
      "href": "image3.jpg",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```
