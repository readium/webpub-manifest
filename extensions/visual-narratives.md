## Introduction

The goal of this document is to provide a profile dedicated to visual narratives for the [Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest) that will cover the following requirements:

- list the different components of a visual narrative
- support multiple resolutions, image formats and/or languages for each visual element of a narrative
- provide guided navigation (also called panel by panel navigation in the case of comics)

While the Visual Narrative Manifest is technically a profile of the Readium Web Publication Manifest, it has its own media type in order to maximize compatibilty with dedicated apps: `application/visual-narrative+json`.


## Listing Visual Narrative Resources

A visual narratived is divided into one or more images, which are all listed in the `readingOrder` of the manifest.

In addition to the normal requirements of a `readingOrder`, all Link Objects have the following additional requirements:
 
 - they <span class="rfc">must</span> point strictly to bitmap images

In addition, all Link Objects <span class="rfc">should</span> include `width` and `height` to indicate the dimensions of each resource

## Alternate Visual Resources

In order to provide multiple variants of the same resource, Link Objects in the `readingOrder` <span class="rfc">may</span> rely on the `alternate` key.

All Link Objects present in the `alternate` array:

- <span class="rfc">must</span> indicate their media-type using `type`
- <span class="rfc">should</span> indicate their dimensions using `height` and `width`
- <span class="rfc">may</span> target a different language using `hreflang`
- <span class="rfc">must not</span> reference a URI template

*Example 1: A resource available in JPEG and WebP*

```
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg", 
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1.webp", 
      "type": "image/webp"
    }
  ]
}
```


*Example 2: A resource available in French and Japanese*

```
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg",
  "hreflang": "fr"
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1-jp.jpeg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "hreflang": "jp"
    }
  ]
}
```

*Example 3: A resource available in two different resolutions*

```
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg", 
  "type": "image/jpeg",
  "width": 546,
  "height": 760,
  "alternate": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1-high.jpeg", 
      "type": "image/jpeg",
      "width": 1092,
      "height": 1520
    }
  ]
}
```

## Guided Navigation

In addition to having [a table of contents](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/#5-table-of-contents), a visual narrative <span class="rfc">may</span> also provide guided navigation where each reference is either:

- pointing directly to a resource (`image1.jpg`)
- or to a fragment of a resource using [Media Fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags) (`image1.jpg#xywh=160,120,320,240`)

This document introduces a new collection role to fulfill that goal:

| Role  | Definition | Compact Collection? | Required? |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| `guided` | Identifies a collection containing guided navigation into a publication. | Yes  | No  |

To avoid duplicating content between `readingOrder` and `guided`, Link Objects referenced in `guided` <span class="rfc">should</span> only contain `href`, `title` and `children`.

This current draft does not cover guided navigation over alternate versions of each image resource.

*Example 4: Guided navigation in a single page*

```
"guided": [
{
  "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg",
  "title": "Page 1",
  "children": [
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg#xywh=0,0,300,200",
      "title": "Panel 1"
    },
    {
      "href": "http://example.org/page1.jpeg#xywh=300,200,310,200",
      "title": "Panel 2"
    }
  ]
}
]
```


## Package

In order to facilitate distribution, both manifest and images can also be distributed using a package based on [the requirements expressed for the Readium Web Publication Manifest](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest#8-package).

To maximize compatibility with comics apps, the package for this profile has its own file extension and media-type:

- its file extension <span class="rfc">must</span> be `.visupub`
- its media type <span class="rfc">must</span> be `application/visual-narrative+zip`

As an alternative, the manifest can also be added to a CBZ file at the same well-known location.
